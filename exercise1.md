There is a team of six is building a Python app that’s almost ready for release. For our CI setup, we’d use common tools from Python’s ecosystem: flake8 or pylint for linting to catch style issues and simple errors, pytest for running tests quickly and reliably, and since Python doesn’t need heavy building, we might package the app with setuptools or create a Docker image for deployment. Besides Jenkins or GitHub Actions, other good CI options include GitLab CI if we use GitLab for our code, CircleCI for a straightforward cloud setup, or Travis CI which works well for basic open-source projects. Deciding between self-hosted (like running Jenkins on our own server) or cloud-based CI (like GitHub Actions) depends on a few things: self-hosted gives full control and suits secret projects but takes time and money to manage servers, while cloud-based is faster to start, cheaper for small teams, and avoids maintenance hassle but may raise worries about code security. To choose, we’d need to know if our app is highly confidential, whether we can handle server costs, and if we prefer speed over control. For most small teams like ours, a cloud-based tool is simpler unless we have strict security rules or special needs.
